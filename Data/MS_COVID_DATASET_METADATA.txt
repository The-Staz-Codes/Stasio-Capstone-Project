This data set, titled Patient-level dataset to study the effect of COVID-19 in people with Multiple Sclerosis, was obtained through PhysioNet:

This dataset was collected to study the effects of COVID-19 in people with Multiple Sclerosis due to their heightened susceptibility to infections and concerns about how the disease interacts with their central nervous system. The data was collected via direct entry into a created platform, done by clinicians, the person with MS being studied, or a representative either in a hospital setting or at home. Although not specified, collection presumably began toward the start of the pandemic and was terminated on February 3rd, 2022. It contains information about smoking habits, COVID-19 symptoms, treatment, and whether patients recovered from 1141 people with MS. 

The dataset was modified in the following ways:
- Since the values for "current_or_former_smoker" were either "Yes" or empty, I filled the empty spaces with "Unanswered" to account for the true answer being No, patients who are current or former smokers but were too embarrassed to answer, etc. 
- Changed "age_in_cat" column name to "age_category"
- Changed "bmi_in_cat2" column name to "bmi_category"
- Changed "current_dmt" column name to "status_dmt"
- Changed edss_in_cat2" column name to "edss_category"
- Changed "ms_type2" column name to "ms_type" 
- Changed "duration_treatment_cat" column name to "treatment_duration_category" 
- Changed "stop_or_end_date_combined" column name to "end_date"
- Changed "covid19_outcome_levels_2" column name to "covid19_outcome"
